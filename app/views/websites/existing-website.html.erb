<h4>Why Ruby on Rails?
</h4>

<i>“Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to programming.
Powerful web applications that formerly might have taken weeks or months
to develop can be produced in a matter of days.”
-Tim O'Reilly, Founder of O'Reilly Media </i>
</p>

<p>
I started my Web Development career few years ago, when I bought my very first book - Html coding.
For the next months all I've been doing is reading books and tutorials on how to build simple website using those new fancy technologies. Wasn't long when I discovered that building every single website from scratch and write the same code over and over gets frustrating and boring.

I had to find something to help me develop websites faster, better and easier! This is when I discovered frameworks.

<span class="pull-right"><%= image_tag '/images/ruby-on-rails.png' %></span>

First I've learned styling framerwork called "Skeleton", it helped me to understand and build my very first "Responsive Website". But that wasn't all I needed to satisfy future customers, I needed something that will allow me to build websites even faster and with minimum effort when writing very complicated code.</p>

<h4>Ruby on Rails came to me</h4>
<p>
My greatest discovery was a programming language called "Ruby". 
Ruby is an interpreted programming language allowing to write complicated code fast and easy, the fact that I already learned some PHP and JavaScript made it so simple to understand it!<br />
As I was speaking about the frameworks just above this paragraph, Ruby has a default framework that comes with the installation called Rails - "Ruby on Rails", Rails gave me a huge amount of options to show off! All the advanced stuff I've been learning through last years became so simple and easy! The code that would take me few days to write now with "RoR" takes moments.</p>
<p>
I still haven't discovered all the power of Ruby on Rails, but one I know for sure. I will what it takes to become an expert, having an opportunity to work on a large scale websites would be the point in my life when I can say - I've succeeded father. You can now be proud of me.</p>

<p>Please help me to pursue my dream and share this website</p>

<h5>See what our clients say</h5>
<ul>
<li>Oliver Rodway</li>
<p>Developing my website with Thomas has been a great experience. He seems to really cares about his work and his clients. He has worked hard to get the job done just right and to create the website just as I wanted it - while at the same time advising on the best way to go about things - very important for someone who's not exactly computer literate! The collaboration has been great. At every step of the process Thomas has listened to my ideas and done his best to bring them to life while at the same offering his own suggestions. He has kept me up to date with everything that he's done and explained the whole process thoroughly. All of my questions have been answered in a detailed yet easily understandable manner. The website looks very professional and eye-catching and once it was completed Thomas was happy to make all the little amendments I felt were necessary - at no extra cost. I'm looking forward to seeing how the new website affects business and if his work on getting hits is anything like his work producing the site I will be more than happy. All this at a very reasonable price - I'm very glad I decided to work with him. Thanks a lot! </p>
